LEARNING OBJECTIVES

[x] Focus on the basics
[x] Solidify my knowledge of C
[x] Build a project that is immediately useful to me
[x] Learn more about iptables and securing my sites
[x] Confirm I can easily use database like sqlite3 with my project

I believe I met all of these objective during the course of me working on the project.

I typically host my wordpress/tinker sites on DigitalOcean, and when I looked at my auth.log, I quickly came to realization I should probably do something about all of the attempts to ssh into my machines. That is when I got the idea for this project.

SETUP
1. Ubuntu Server VirtualBox (judging from videos from prior year I don't need to describe steps)
2. Ensure you are running your Ubuntu Network as Bridged Adapter to have a dedicated IP for testing
3. Install sqlite3 and libraries: sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev
(NOTE: if I shared compiled program I do suggest a user runs this command)
4. Carefully follow instructions printed via ./bin/bouncer50 -a mode and ensure your config file matches what is required by the Program
5. Remember to restart sshd on your server for the changes to take effect!
6. Run the program (please see the video for an example: https://youtu.be/6ZbQ_Dcponk)

TROUBLESHOOTING:
remove iptables rules: # iptables -D INPUT 1
kill the bouncer50 process: # pkill bouncer50
